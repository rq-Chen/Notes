## Derivatives & Relevant Concepts

- Derivative (全导数):
  - the changing speed of f(X) when X travels along a curve $$l(t)$$
  - $$f'(t) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(X(t + h)) - f(X(t))}{h}, X \in \R^n$$
  - $$f'(t) = \nabla f \cdot (x_1', x_2', \dots, x_n')$$
- Partial derivative:
  - when $$l(t)$$ is exactly one axis
  - $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i + h, \dots, x_n) - f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i, \dots, x_n)}{h}$$
- Directional derivative:
  - when $$l(t)$$ is a straight line in one direction $$\bold{v}$$
  - $$\nabla_{\bold{V}}f(X) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(X + h\bold{v}) - f(X)}{h} = \nabla f \cdot \bold{v}$$
- Gradient:
  - The gradient of a scalar field is a vector field: $$\nabla f = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2},\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n})f = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2},\dots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n})$$
  - $$\nabla$$ is called Hamilton operator
- Divergence:
  - Definition: 
    - The divergence of a vector field $$\bold{F}(\bold{x})$$ at a point x0 is defined as the limit of the ratio of the surface integral of F out of the surface of a closed volume V enclosing x0 to the volume of V
    - $$\nabla \cdot \bold{F} = \lim_{V \to 0}\frac{1}{|V|} \oiint_{S(V)}\bold{F}\cdot\bold{\vec{n}}\ dS$$, where *n* is the outward unit normal to *S*
    - Relationship with *Gauss's theorem*: $$\iiint_U\nabla\cdot\bold{F} dV = \oiint_{\partial U}\bold{F}\cdot\bold{n}\ dS$$
  - Explanation:
    - The extent to which the point behaves like a source: sink if negative, no flux if zero, source if positive
  - Calculation: 
    - $$\nabla\cdot \bold{F} = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}) \cdot \bold{F} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n}\frac{\partial F_{x_j}}{\partial x_j}$$
- Curl:
  - Definition: 
    - the limit of the ratio between the circular integral of a vector field and the area surrounded by the circle
    - $$\bold{Curl}\ \vec{A}(\vec{r}) = \vec{n}_{\Delta S} \lim_{\Delta S\to 0}\frac{\oint \vec{A}\cdot d\vec{l}}{\Delta S}$$
  - Explanation: 
    - the curl of a vector field is another vector field, describing the infinitesimal circulation of the field
    - the direction of the curl field follows right-hand law accroding to the original circulation's direction
  - Computation:
    - "Cross product" between the Hamilton operator and the vector field: $$\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\ F_x & F_y & F_z\end{vmatrix}$$
- Laplacian:
  - Definition: 
    - the Laplacian of a scalar function is the divergence of its gradient field
    - $$\Delta f = \nabla^2f = \nabla \cdot(\nabla f) = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2_i}$$
  - Explanation:
    - If $$\phi$$ denotes the electrostatic potential associated to a charge distribution *q*, then $$q = -\epsilon_0\Delta\phi$$, where ε0 is the electric constant.
    - If *f* is the phase distribution, then its Lapalican can indicate where may be the source of a spherical travelling wave
