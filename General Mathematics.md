## Branches of Mathematics

- Algebra: concrete instances or abstract concepts
- Number theory: not only numbers, but also the structures initially created to solve relevant problems
- Geometry: concrete instances or abstract concepts; topology, differential topology (smooth manifolds), etc.
- Algebraic Geometry: manifolds defined by polynomials
- Analysis:
  - objects: different spaces or algebras (e.g. Hilbert space, Von Neumann algebra, etc.) that must be analyzed through approximation (which makes them "analysis") due to infinite dimensionality
  - branches: dynamics, PDE, etc.
- Logic (broad sense):
  - Set theory
  - Categorical theory
  - Model theory:
    - A model for a collection of axioms is a mathematical structure for which those axioms, suitably interpreted, are true.
    - For example, any concrete example of a group is a model for the axioms of group theory.
  - Logic (narrow sense)
- Combinatorics (discrete mathematics)
  - Graph theory is part of extremal and probablistic combinatorics
- Theoretical Computer Science
- Probability
- Mathematical Physics
